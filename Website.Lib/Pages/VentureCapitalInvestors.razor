                        Dioptra will soon build a team to expand its SaaS real estate analytics product offering. We are searching
                        for talented technologists and real estate/banking analysts. We are interested in the diverse skills that you can bring
                        rather than focussing on specific prior knowledge. Our approach is that we like to mentor great candidates: it's all about
                        your potential. If you're interested to talk, please just get in touch and don't worry if you're unsure whether you fit precisely
                        what we are after. We value your diverse skills.

                        Real estate investment is complex business with a blizzard of detailed cashflow that drives returns at all levels of the capital
                        structure. Dioptra's job is to manage this data, tracking detailed cashflow and producing penny-accurate capital structure and waterfall
                        analysis. Additionally, Dioptra forecasts future performance arising from micro and macro economic factors.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        On the micro front, Dioptra tracks variance between budgets and actually observed cashflow, which has a lot to say about future potential
                        performance. From a macro economic perspective interest rates drive contractual debt interest due, and liquid traded yield curves spell out
                        a central forecast of likely asset and loan performance. Interest rate options markets determine expected variance to this central forecast.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        As an analyst at Dioptra, your role will be to disentangle this broad dataset by applying both traditional real estate cashflow analysis
                        and stochastic mathematical proceses used in derivatives trading. This already gives our clients resolution on portfolio risks and opportunities
                        substantially beyond other real estate financial analytics systems' capability.

                        We will hire <strong>programmers</strong>, <strong>data engineers</strong> and <strong>designers</strong> with a range of skills. Our stack is
                        centred around ASP.NET and is hosted on Azure. We seek a broad range of skills among our technologists and you don't necessarily need to have these
                        two core skills.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        We are interested in engineering excellence. Dioptra performs rich data analysis in a very performant manner: most of a user's experience involves latency
                        under 50ms. Dioptra feels as performant as a lightweight spreadsheet, despite turning around some heavy duty compute load. If you are a programmer you will
                        further use all your skills to enhance this UX excellence despite every increasing workload and scale.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        As a data engineer you will straddle the technology and analyst teams. Our innaugural product's data model already has almost 200 entities and this will grow substantially. To imagine the
                        scale of the dataset, consider how Dioptra will model complex construction projects. Stand in front of a large building and start to look at all the materials
                        used in its construction, from concrete, throught wood, to pipework, electrical conduits and even nuts and bolts. You will model the lot. For real estate occupied by tenants,
                        consider the cashflow associated with a large retail mall: rent, utility costs, parking revenues, etc. Again this is a huge dataset.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mdc-typography--body1">
                        Dioptra is committed to great design. Even at this stage we are one of the co-sponsors of <a href="https://material-blazor.com" target="_blank">Material.Blazor</a>,
                        an open source library integrating Google's Material Design web implementation with ASP.NET Blazor. This was featured by Micrsoft in an
                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzLDvQ-bOw8" target="_blank">ASP.NET Community Standup</a> video stream in late 2020. As a designer you will deliver
                        best in class desgin to make Dioptra's UX as intuitive and fluid as possible.
